This is a fork of SWFUpload v2.5.0 beta3.2 from
http://code.google.com/p/swfupload/source/browse/swfupload/branches/SWFUpload+Resize/?r=915

It contains the following changes:

* splits the Alchemy JPEG encoder library into a separate SWF that is dynamically loaded
only when needed, in order to reduce the size of swfupload.swf dramatically.
see http://code.google.com/p/swfupload/issues/detail?id=258

An corresponding setting jpegencoder_url has been added to the JavaScript object.

* conditional compilation options to strip out debugging information, resulting in 
additional decrease in size of swfupload.swf

* works around bug in IE: http://code.google.com/p/swfupload/issues/detail?id=257

See https://github.com/youngj/swfupload/downloads for the compiled SWF and JavaScript 
files to include in your project.
